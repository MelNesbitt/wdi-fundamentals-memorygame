# wdi-fundamentals-memorygame
This is my first project for the General Assembly SEI pre-work! For this project, I created and styled a web-based card matching game. To play, click on two cards to see if you are able to find a match. If you match your cards, you will receive one point, but if you don't match you cards, you will lose one point. You can reset the board after each match using the reset button at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!
